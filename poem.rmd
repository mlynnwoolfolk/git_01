## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,
      Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
      The billows smooth and bright —
And this was odd, because it was
      The middle of the night.

The moon was shining sulkily,
      Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
      After the day was done —
"It's very rude of him," she said,
      "To come and spoil the fun."

ChatGPT
In gardens lush, where sunbeams play,
Lilies dance in colors gay,
Their petals soft, a gentle sway,
In fragrant realms, they hold their stay.

With grace they bloom, in pure delight,
Each petal whispers secrets bright,
A symphony of ivory white,
Painting landscapes with pure light.

In morning dew, they find their bliss,
In twilight's glow, they softly kiss,
Their fragrance lingers, nothing amiss,
In dreams, they weave eternal bliss.

Amidst the chaos, they stand serene,
In every garden, a reigning queen,
With every bloom, a tale unseen,
In lilies' realm, where dreams convene.

Their elegance, a timeless art,
In every beat, they play their part,
In every garden, they impart,
A touch of heaven to every heart.

So let them bloom, in fields afar,
In whispers soft, beneath each star,
For in their beauty, near and far,
Lilies enchant, a wonder bizarre.
